### Hi there 👋

I'm a 🇧🇷 brazilian software engineering student at UCSAL. Currently, I'm working on my personal projects and seeking knowledge, especially about the enterprise world and, of course, growing up my abilities as a coder. Actually, I'd consider myself an intermediary programmer focused on web and familiar with: C#, JavaScript and TypeScript. 🎈
