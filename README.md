### Hi there 👋

I'm a 🇧🇷 brazilian software engineering student at <strong>UCSAL (Universidade Católica do Salvador)</strong>. Currently, I'm working on my personal projects and seeking knowledge, especially about the enterprise world and, of course, growing up my abilities as a coder. Actually, I'd consider myself an intermediary programmer focused on web and familiar with: 
<strong>C#, JavaScript and TypeScript.</strong> 🎈
